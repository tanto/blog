		<description><![CDATA[Riporto qui sotto due call per la ricerca di altrettanti volontari GIS da coinvolgere in un progetto in Nigeria per la costruzione di una Metadata Clearinghouse nazionale, e un altro a New Orleans per un esperto ArcGIS Server. 
Ovviamente si lavorerebbe in remoto.
Entrambe le deadline sono strette: il 29 novembre.

Pensateci...

---------------------------------------------
GISCorps is recruiting for two projects!

1) Metadata Clearinghouse Node Specialist - Nigeria

This project is commissioned by Geographical Resources for Development Centre (GRDC), a non profit organization in Lagos, Nigeria.

The NGO is seeking the assistance of one volunteer to establish a metadata clearing house node for Nigeria. It is the hope of GRDC that the application’s ease of use will encourage others to contribute their metadata.

Duties of the volunteer include:

- Assist in design and establishment of a web-based clearing house that will allow NGO and others to publish metadata on spatial data for Nigeria.
- Assist with operating the clearinghouse until staff is prepared to assume responsibilities for operation.
- Provide operational instructions/procedures for the clearinghouse.
- Train staff on maintenance of the system and provide consultation on future growth.

Estimated duration of Service: 1-4 months (depending on the volunteer’s availability)

Type of mission: this mission does NOT require traveling and is conducted remotely. The volunteer will be using their own software and hardware to develop the application. The volunteer will be working closely with the GRDC representative throughout the project via emails, phone, VoIP, and FTP site (if necessary).

If you are interested and available, please send an email to m.salling@csuohio.edu by Sunday November 29, 2009. Along with the email, please send us your updated resume since the resume on our web site may not include your latest information.

2) ArcGIS Server Programmer – New Orleans, LA

This project is commissioned by Neighborhood Housing Services of New Orleans (NHS - http://www.nhsnola.org/) via the University of New Orleans - Department of Planning &amp; Urban Studies (UNO-PLUS - http://planning.uno.edu/). NHS is a non-profit organization in New Orleans, LA.

Neighborhood Housing Services of New Orleans has been serving New Orleans neighborhoods for over 30 years. They help stabilize and invigorate neighborhoods by targeting vacant and blighted housing for redevelopment, providing homeownership opportunities to low- and moderate-income families through homebuyer education, foreclosure prevention counseling, financial literacy training, low-cost lending and home repair services. Their community organizers build human and social capital in target neighborhoods through resident-led programs.

Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) addresses the challenge of vacant and blighted property in New Orleans by surveying and mapping the property conditions in four target neighborhoods. In the process, they have developed efficient systems that they hope to share with other neighborhood organizations across New Orleans. They now wish to create a dynamic web site to share their data and build surveying capacity in other neighborhoods. They expect the site will be more than a map; a participatory process to document New Orleans’ recovery and improve public services.

NHS has secured access to ArcGIS Server 9.3 (housed at the University of New Orleans) and is now looking for an ArcGIS Server (AGS) Programmer to create a customized application. The application’s capabilities include:

- basic navigation tools
- scale dependent labeling either simple or in a call-out (street names, property address, results of the survey, etc.)
- querying by address and property condition categories (for example: &#039;Vacant&#039; and &#039;Poor condition&#039; or &#039;Fair Condition&#039;) and identifying the results on a record by record basis with its associating attributes
- exporting of selected records and creating reports from selected records
- caching &amp; publishing static datasets such as aerial photography
- creating thematic layers by various attributes (structure’s condition: vacant, blighted, etc.)
- buffering
- printing to PDF
- automatic upload of excel spreadsheets
- the site might require secure logins; therefore, expertise in setting up security for AGS applications/services is highly desirable.
- data layers that are currently in the geodatabase include: Council District Boundaries, Neighborhood Boundaries, Planning District Boundaries, Street Centerlines, Water, Parks, Parcels, Central City 2008 NHS Survey Data joined to Parcels

Duration: +/- 9 months or earlier depending on the volunteer’s availability. The work could start immediately.

Type of mission: this mission does NOT require traveling and is conducted remotely. The volunteer will be using their own hardware connecting to the university’s server to develop the application via VPN connection. The volunteer will be working closely with the UNO-PLUS and NHS representatives throughout the project via emails, phone, VoIP, and FTP site (if necessary).

If you are interested and available, please send an email to shoreh.elhami@gmail.com by Sunday November 29, 2009. Along with the email, please send us your updated resume since the resume on our web site may not include your latest information.

We are very excited about these projects and are looking forward to hearing back from you.
