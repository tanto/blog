		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for very interesting article Antonio.
why sUAV are still relatively uncommon? One more issue in my opinion is that UAV not allow to operate easily if the weather conditions are not perfect.
Aircraft has the same problems but allow to operate in larger range of weather conditions.
Wind can limit heavily the activities and don’t allow to set up planning in the advance.
The difference between industrial processes and artisan processes is the ability to plan and deliver on time and on budget.]]></description>
